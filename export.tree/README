Title: 28andHe

Background: In this dense-sampling, deep phenotyping study, we determined whether diurnal variation in steroid hormone concentrations in a male impacts large-scale brain network connectivity and whole-brain structure.  

Participant: The participant is a right-handed Caucasian male, aged 26 years for duration of the study. The participant had no history of neuropsychiatric diagnosis, endocrine disorders, or prior head trauma. The participant gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the University of California, Santa Barbara Human Subjects Committee. 

Study Design: The participant underwent daily testing for 30 consecutive days. Sessions occurred in the morning for the first 10 days, both morning and evening for the following 10 days, and in the evenings for the last 10 days, resulting in 40 sessions total. Each test session began with a daily questionnaire, followed by endocrine sampling at 7am (morning sessions) and at 8pm (evening sessions). The participant gave a 2mL saliva sample at each session, followed by a blood sample. On days with two sessions, the participant underwent one blood draw per day per safety guidelines. Morning endocrine samples were collected after at least 8 hours of overnight fasting, and evening endocrine samples were collected following an hour and a half of abstaining from consumption of food or drink (excluding water). The participant refrained from consuming caffeinated beverages before each morning session. The MRI session lasted one hour and consisted of structural and functional MRI sequences.

Behavioral Assessments: To monitor state-dependent mood and lifestyle measures throughout the two studies, the following scales (adapted to reflect the past 24 hours) were administered each session: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1983), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI: Buysse et al., 1989), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI: Speilberger & Vagg, 1984), Profile of Mood States (POMS: Pollock et al., 1979), and Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992). The questionnaire for the evening sessions excluded the PSQI to avoid redundancy. Behavioral data can be found under 'participants.tsv'

MRI Acquisition: At each session, the participant underwent a structural MRI and 15-minute eyes-open resting state scan conducted on a Siemens 3T Prisma scanner equipped with a 64-channel phased-array head coil. First, high-resolution anatomical scans were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR = 2500 ms, TE = 2.31 ms, TI = 934 ms, flip angle = 7º, .8 mm thickness), followed by a gradient echo fieldmap (TR = 758 ms, TE1 = 4.92 ms, TE2 = 7.38 ms, flip angle = 60°). Next, the participant completed a 15-minute resting-state fMRI scan using a T2*-weighted multiband echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast (72 oblique slices, TR = 720 ms, TE = 37 ms, voxel size = 2mm3 190 , flip angle = 56º, MB factor = 8). A T2- weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) scan was also acquired with an oblique coronal orientation positioned orthogonally to the main axis of the hippocampus (TR/TE= 8100/50 ms, flip angle = 122°, 0.4 × 0.4 mm2 in plane resolution, 2 mm slice thickness, 31 interleaved slices with no gap, total acquisition time = 4:21 min). In an effort to minimize motion, the head was secured with a 3D-printed foam head case. Physiological recordings were obtained at each session.

Physiology Assessments: Bioimpedance was measured via Trans-radial electrical bioimpedance velocimetry (TREV). This bioimpedance signal can be used to calculate estimates of heart contractility (sympathetic drive), pulse rate, and stroke volume, among others.
